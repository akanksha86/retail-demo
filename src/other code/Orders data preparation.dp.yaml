        Create a series of common table expressions (CTEs): s0 selects all columns from the 'orders' table, s1 adds a date column 'order_date' derived from the 'order_date' column in s0, s2 adds a formatted date column 'order_month' in 'YYYY-MM' format derived from the 'order_date' column in s1, and s3 filters s2 to include only rows where 'is_returned' is false, then select all columns from s3.
